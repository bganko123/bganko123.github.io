# Deep learning, day 1 - hour zero
This is the first of many blog post, these are new exciting times.

I have just set up the blog. It wasn't too difficult and the instructions provided by the fastai course are very comprehensive and informative so props to them. After a few mistakes with file names, the blog seems to be up and running and behaving as expected. Lets hope the metophorical weather stays this mild. Now onto the fastai course proper. Something about birds here I come.
